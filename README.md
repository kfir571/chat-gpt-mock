## 📝 Notes

- In the **ChatInput** component, **only the rightmost "send" button** (the upward arrow) is functional.
- The following buttons are **currently non-functional** and for UI purposes only:
  - ➕ (Add content)
  - 🌐 (Globe)
  - ⋯ (More options)
  - 🎤 (Microphone)
- These buttons are styled to match the modern chat design, and can be extended in future updates.
